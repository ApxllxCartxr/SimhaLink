## üîß **Technical Architecture**

### **Service Layer: GroupManagementService**

#### **Core Operations**
```dart
// Get comprehensive group information
getGroupInfo(groupId) ‚Üí GroupInfo?
getGroupInfoStream(groupId) ‚Üí Stream<GroupInfo?>

// Member management
kickMember(groupId, memberId) ‚Üí bool
changeMemberRole(groupId, memberId, newRole) ‚Üí bool

// Group lifecycle
leaveGroup(groupId) ‚Üí bool
deleteGroup(groupId) ‚Üí bool
```

#### **Real-time Data Management**
- **Firebase Streams**: Live updates for member status and group changes
- **Batch Operations**: Atomic transactions for complex operations like group deletion
- **Activity Tracking**: Automatic member presence updates

### **Data Models**

#### **GroupInfo Class**
```dart
class GroupInfo {
  String id, name, code, description;
  DateTime createdAt;
  List<GroupMember> members;
  int totalMembers, activeMembers, maxMembers;
  bool isActive;
}
```

#### **GroupMember Class**
```dart
class GroupMember {
  String id, name, email, role;
  DateTime joinedAt, lastSeen;
  bool isActive, isOnline;
  String roleDisplayName; // Formatted with emojis
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Permissions**

### **Role-Based Access Control**
1. **Participants**: Can view group info and leave group
2. **Volunteers**: Can view member details and leave group  
3. **VIPs**: Can view member details and leave group
4. **Organizers**: Can manage members, change roles, kick users, delete group

### **Authorization Checks**

```javascript
groups/{groupId} {
  // Existing fields plus:
  memberCount: number,
  maxMembers: number,
  isActive: boolean,
  
  // Subcollections:
  members/{userId} {
    name, email, role, joinedAt, lastSeen, isActive
  },
  
  audit_log/{logId} {
    action, targetUserId, timestamp, performedBy, details
  }
}
```

### **User Document Updates**
```javascript
users/{userId} {
  // Existing fields plus:
  leftGroups: string[],      // Groups user has left
