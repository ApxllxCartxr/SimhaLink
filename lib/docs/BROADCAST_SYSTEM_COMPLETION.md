# Broadcast System Implementation

## Overview

The broadcast system enables organizers to send targeted messages to specific groups within the SimhaLink app, including all users or just volunteers. This feature is restricted to users with the organizer role for security and organizational purposes.

## Key Components

### 1. **Role-Based Authorization**
- **Role Check**: Added `RoleUtils` utility to centrally handle role checks
- **Permission Control**: Only organizers can access broadcast composition screens
- **UI Adaptation**: UI elements change based on user role

### 2. **Targeted Messaging**
- **Message Targeting**: Messages can be sent to specific groups:
  - All users
  - Participants only
  - Volunteers only
  - VIPs only
  - Group-specific messages

### 3. **Priority Levels**
- **Message Priority**: Four priority levels (low, normal, high, urgent)
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded by priority for quick recognition

### 4. **User Experience**
- **Organizer Experience**: Full access to create broadcasts with target selection
- **Volunteer/Participant Experience**: Can only view broadcasts relevant to their role
- **Access Control**: Non-organizers attempting to access composition screens are shown permission messages

## Implementation Details

1. **User Role Verification**
   - Implemented `RoleUtils.isUserOrganizer()` for centralized role checking
   - Added role verification in both UI and service layers

2. **UI Updates**
   - Modified `BroadcastListScreen` to conditionally show compose button for organizers
   - Updated `BroadcastComposeScreen` with permission checks and UI feedback
   - Added role-specific messaging in empty states

3. **Service Layer**
   - Enhanced `BroadcastService.sendBroadcast()` with strict role validation
   - Improved targeting logic in message delivery

## Testing

1. **Permission Testing**
   - Verified organizers can create and send broadcasts
   - Confirmed non-organizers cannot access broadcast composition

2. **Targeting Testing**
   - Tested message delivery to specific roles (all users, volunteers only)
   - Validated that users only receive broadcasts intended for their role

## Future Improvements

1. **Analytics**: Track broadcast engagement metrics
2. **Rich Content**: Support for images and formatted text
3. **Scheduled Broadcasts**: Allow scheduling messages for future delivery
4. **Templates**: Pre-defined templates for common broadcast types
