- `transferTicketToGroupMember()` - Executes secure ticket transfers with audit trail

âœ… **Booking Modification Support**
- `modifyBooking()` - Allows adding/removing passengers from existing bookings
- Capacity validation and proper ticket ID generation
- Audit trail for all modifications

## ðŸŽª **User Flow Examples**

### **Scenario 1: User Attempts Duplicate Booking**
1. User navigates to transport booking
2. System detects existing booking
3. Shows informative dialog with existing booking details
4. Provides options to view/manage existing booking
5. Prevents duplicate booking creation

### **Scenario 2: Group Member Transfer**
1. User opens confirmed booking in My Bookings
2. Selects "Transfer Tickets" option
3. System validates group membership
4. Shows only same-group members as transfer recipients
5. Allows selection of own tickets and target member
6. Executes transfer with audit trail
7. Updates all relevant documents atomically

### **Scenario 3: Cross-Group Transfer Attempt**
1. User attempts to transfer ticket
2. System validates group membership
3. Detects different groups or no group membership
4. Shows clear error message explaining group-only restriction
5. Provides educational information about security policy

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Database Operations**
- **Transactions**: All critical operations use Firebase transactions
- **Validation**: Multi-layer validation at service and UI levels
- **Indexing**: Efficient queries with proper field indexing
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history tracking for transfers and modifications

### **Error Handling**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Proper fallbacks for network issues
- **User Feedback**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- **Recovery**: Ability to retry failed operations

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Efficient Queries**: Minimal database reads with targeted queries
- **Caching**: Proper state management to avoid unnecessary requests
- **Lazy Loading**: Group member data loaded only when needed
