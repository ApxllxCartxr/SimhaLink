# Logout and Group Management Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… **Duplicate Logout Buttons**
**Problem**: Two logout buttons were present - one in leading position (left) and one in popup menu (right)
**Solution**: Removed the leading logout button, kept only the one in the popup menu for better UX

### 2. âœ… **Logout Navigation Errors**
**Problem**: App crashed with route error when trying to navigate to `/auth` after logout
```
Could not find a generator for route RouteSettings("/auth", null)
```
**Solution**: 
- Replaced `pushReplacementNamed('/auth')` with direct navigation to `AuthWrapper`
- Added proper error handling and prevented multiple logout calls
- Let AuthWrapper's StreamBuilder handle auth state changes automatically

### 3. âœ… **Multiple Logout Events**
**Problem**: Firebase was triggering multiple sign-out events causing confusion
**Solution**:
- Added `_isSigningOut` state management to AuthService
- Added `_isLoggingOut` state management to MapScreen
- Prevented multiple simultaneous logout calls

### 4. âœ… **Attendees Can't Leave Groups Properly**
**Problem**: `clearGroupData()` only cleared local preferences but didn't remove user from Firebase group
**Solution**:
- Updated `_handleLeaveGroup()` to properly remove user from Firebase group's `memberIds`
- Added FCM unsubscription when leaving groups
- Added proper confirmation dialogs
- Clear any restrictions that might prevent joining new groups

### 5. âœ… **Users Who Leave Groups Can't Join New Ones**
**Problem**: Users who left default groups couldn't join new groups due to state management issues
**Solution**:
- Updated `clearGroupData()` to clear attendee restrictions
- Added `_clearAttendeeGroupRestrictions()` method to reset join capabilities
- Updated AuthWrapper to properly handle users who were removed from groups
- Added better error handling in group joining process

   - Click hamburger menu â†’ Leave Group
   - Confirm in dialog
   - Should return to group creation/selection screen

3. **Rejoin Group Test**:

   - Try to join a different group
   - Should work without issues

4. **Multiple Logout Prevention**:
