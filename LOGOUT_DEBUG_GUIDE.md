# Logout Issue Debugging Guide

## Testing the Logout Fix

The logout inconsistency has been addressed with multiple fallback mechanisms:

### What Changed:

1. **Explicit Navigation**: Added immediate navigation after logout instead of relying solely on StreamBuilder
2. **Loading Dialog**: Shows user that logout is in progress
3. **Timing Improvements**: Added delays to ensure auth state propagates
4. **Force Auth Check**: Added fallback mechanism to double-check auth state
5. **Better Error Handling**: Closes dialogs and shows error messages properly

### Debug Output to Watch:

When you logout, you should see this sequence in the terminal:
```
🚪 Starting sign out process...
✅ Sign out successful - Firebase auth cleared
🔄 Sign out process completed
🔄 AuthWrapper: Auth state changed - null
🚪 AuthWrapper: User not authenticated, showing auth screen
```

### If Logout Still Fails:

If you're still stuck on the map screen after logout, check for:

1. **Terminal Output**: Look for the debug messages above
2. **Auth State**: The `🔄 AuthWrapper: Auth state changed - null` message
3. **Force Check**: Look for `🔄 Force auth check: User is null, ensuring navigation to auth screen`

### Alternative Solution:

If the issue persists, you can temporarily switch to the improved AuthWrapper:

1. In `lib/main.dart`, replace:
   ```dart
   home: const AuthWrapper(),
   ```
   
   With:
   ```dart
   home: const ImprovedAuthWrapper(),
   ```

2. Add the import:
   ```dart
   import 'package:simha_link/screens/improved_auth_wrapper.dart';
   ```

### Manual Test Steps:

1. **Login** to the app
2. **Click** hamburger menu → Logout
3. **Confirm** in dialog
4. **Watch** for "Signing out..." dialog
5. **Should** navigate to login screen within 1-2 seconds

### Known Working Cases:
- ✅ Group leaving and rejoining works perfectly
- ✅ Firebase logout succeeds (shows in terminal)
- ❓ Navigation after logout (should be fixed now)

### Fallback Mechanisms Added:
1. **Immediate Navigation**: Don't wait for StreamBuilder
2. **Delayed Check**: Force check auth state after 500ms
3. **Loading Feedback**: User knows something is happening
4. **Error Recovery**: Closes dialogs on failure

The issue should now be resolved with the immediate navigation approach rather than waiting for Firebase auth state changes to trigger the UI update.
